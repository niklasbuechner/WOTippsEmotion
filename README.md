# WOTippsEmotion

(Deprecated: Since Google change their PageSpeed score calculation, this plugin will no longer result
in a higher PageSpeed score. The plugin is not actively maintained anymore.)

This Shopware plugin was created to speed up the performance of Shopware's emotional shopping worlds.
In the Shopware standard, these emotional shopping worlds are HTML pieces which are loaded after the
`onload` event of the online shop has been fired. This plugin inlines the shopping worlds and thereby
results in a performance boost as well as a better Google PageSpeed score.

The plugin is compatible with Shopware <= 5.3.
